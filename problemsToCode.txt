1. The Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem

2. Segmented Least Squares: Multi-way Choices

we are given a set of
points P = {(x1, y1), (x2 , y2), . . . , (xn , yn )}, with x1 < x2 < . . . < xn . 
We will use pi to denote the point (xi , yi ). We must first partition P into some number
of segments. Each segment is a subset of P that represents a contiguous set
of x-coordinates; that is, it is a subset of the form {pi , pi+1, . . . , pj-1, pj } for
some indices i <= j. Then, for each segment S in our partition of P, we compute
the line minimizing the error with respect to the points in S, according to the
formulas above.
The penalty of a partition is defined to be a sum of the following terms.
(i) The number of segments into which we partition P, times a fixed, given
multiplier C > 0.
(ii) For each segment, the error value of the optimal line through that
segment.
Our goal in the Segmented Least Squares Problem is to find a partition of
minimum penalty.
